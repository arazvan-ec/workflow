## Gaps & Recommendations

- [x] All areas have at least 2 credible sources
- [x] Every recommendation is backed by at least 1 source from 2025+
- [x] Official documentation (Anthropic, Microsoft, AWS) covers the 3 main areas
- [ ] **Gap**: No academic/research paper sources — consider adding arXiv papers on multi-agent orchestration for stronger theoretical backing
- [ ] **Gap**: No source from Google DeepMind or OpenAI on agentic patterns — their official blogs could strengthen Gap 3.1 and 3.2
- [ ] **Gap**: The Ralph Loop pattern (Gap 3.4) only has blog sources — the original Geoffrey Huntley writeup would strengthen this

### Suggested Additional Searches

1. `arXiv multi-agent software engineering 2025` — For academic backing on orchestration patterns
2. `OpenAI cookbook agentic patterns 2025` — For official OpenAI perspective on agent loops
3. `Google DeepMind agent orchestration patterns` — For alternative framework perspectives
4. `Geoffrey Huntley Ralph Wiggum pattern original` — For primary source on autonomous loops

## Contradictions Found

| Topic | Source A says | Source B says | Implication |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| SDD sustainability | Martin Fowler notes SDD shares risks with MDD (model-driven development) — non-determinism + inflexibility | Thoughtworks, JetBrains present SDD as clearly superior to "vibe coding" | SDD is the best current practice but should be adopted with awareness that it may evolve significantly. Don't over-invest in rigid tooling around it. |
| Group chat agents | Microsoft recommends limiting group chat to ≤3 agents | Plugin has 4 review agents that could run concurrently | Consider whether all 4 review agents need to run in the same context, or if sequential/batched execution is better |
| Context size | Anthropic says "smallest possible set of high-signal tokens" | Plugin loads ~88KB of documentation potential | The plugin's Context Activation Model (progressive loading) partially addresses this, but the always-loaded content (CLAUDE.md + framework_rules) still needs trimming |
