# Capability Providers — Model-Agnostic Abstraction Layer

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Added in**: Plugin v2.6.0

---

## Overview

The plugin provides its own abstraction layer for capabilities that vary across Claude model versions. Instead of being locked to a specific model, the plugin defines **provider interfaces** — stable commands and behaviors that work identically from the user's perspective, while routing to different implementations based on the running model's capabilities.

**Principle**: The user always uses `/workflows:work --mode=stacks|layers`, `/workflow:checkpoint`, etc. The plugin resolves the best implementation underneath.

```
User Command                        Provider Resolution              Implementation

## How Detection Works

Detection is a two-step process combining **self-awareness** (Claude knows its model) with **tool inspection** (Claude checks available tools).

### Step 1: Model Self-Identification

Claude's system prompt includes its model identity. Use this for detection:

```
Detection Rule:
  IF model name contains "opus-4-6" or later  →  tier: advanced
  IF model name contains "opus-4-5" or "opus-4-1"  →  tier: standard
  IF model name contains "sonnet"  →  tier: standard
  IF model name contains "haiku"  →  tier: lightweight
  OTHERWISE  →  tier: standard (safe default)
```

### Step 2: Tool Availability Check

Before using a capability, verify the required tool exists:

```
For Agent Teams:
  Check: Is TeammateTool available in your tool list?
  YES → agent-teams provider available
  NO  → fall back to worktrees provider

For Context Fork:
  Check: Can you use the Task tool with subagent_type?
  YES → fork available (always true in Claude Code)
  NO  → shared context only
```

### Step 3: Configuration Override

Read `core/providers.yaml` for explicit overrides:

```
IF providers.parallelization == "auto"  →  use detection (steps 1-2)
IF providers.parallelization == "agent-teams"  →  force Agent Teams
IF providers.parallelization == "worktrees"  →  force worktrees
```

## Provider: Parallelization

### Interface (What Users See)

```bash
# Always the same command, regardless of provider
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=stacks
```

### Implementation: Agent Teams (tier: advanced)

**Prerequisites**: Claude Opus 4.6+, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`

**Behavior**:
1. Orchestrator (current session) creates shared task list from `tasks.md`
2. Spawns teammates via `TeammateTool` for each role
3. Each teammate gets: role definition, feature state, task assignments
4. Teammates work in independent context windows
5. Direct inter-agent communication for coordination
6. Orchestrator monitors progress and resolves conflicts
7. Results synchronized back to `tasks.md`

**Advantages over worktrees**:
- No tmux/filesystem setup required
- Direct communication (not just file-based)
- Orchestrator can reassign work dynamically
- Native progress tracking

**What stays the same**:
- `tasks.md` still updated (persistent state)
- Role definitions still apply (one role per agent)
- Quality gates still enforced (checkpoints, Bounded Correction Protocol)

### Implementation: Worktrees + tmux (tier: standard, lightweight)

**Prerequisites**: git >= 2.30, tmux >= 3.0

**Behavior**:
1. Creates git worktrees for each role
2. Launches tmux session with panes
3. Sets environment variables per pane
4. Coordination via `tasks.md` + git sync
5. Manual cleanup on completion

**This is the existing behavior** — no changes needed.

### Transition Guide

```
When moving from worktrees to Agent Teams:

1. `/workflows:work --mode=stacks` still works identically from user perspective
2. tasks.md remains the persistent state layer
4. tmux is no longer needed (but doesn't break anything if installed)
5. Port allocation is no longer needed (agents share filesystem)
```

## Provider: Context Management

### Interface (What Users See)

```bash
# Always the same commands
/workflow:checkpoint --name="checkpoint-1"
# To restore: read tasks.md + git log to resume from last checkpoint
```

### Implementation: Compaction-Aware (tier: advanced)

**Prerequisites**: Opus 4.6+ with Compaction API

**Key differences**:
- **Relaxed thresholds**: Context auto-summarized by server
  - Compact suggestion at 85% (not 70%)
  - Max files: 50 (not 20)
  - Max session: 4h (not 2h)
  - Max messages: 150 (not 50)
- **`pre_compact.sh` still fires**: Preserves state before server compaction
- **Snapshots for handoffs only**: Not needed for context exhaustion

**Snapshot behavior**:
- Snapshots still work identically (for role handoffs, session boundaries)
- No longer the primary defense against context loss
- Recommended at milestones, not every 30 minutes

### Implementation: Manual Snapshots (tier: standard, lightweight)

**Prerequisites**: None (built-in)

**This is the existing behavior** — strict thresholds, proactive monitoring, frequent checkpoints. See `SESSION_CONTINUITY.md`.

### Threshold Comparison

| Metric | Manual Snapshots | Compaction-Aware |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Compact suggestion | 70% | 85% |
| Max files read | 20 | 50 |
| Max session duration | 2h | 4h |
| Max messages | 50 | 150 |
| Snapshot frequency | Every 30-45 min | At milestones only |
| Context urgency | High (critical resource) | Low (auto-managed) |

## Provider: Fork Strategy

### Interface (What Users See)

```yaml
# Skill authors declare fork as before
---
name: my-skill
context: fork
---
```

### Implementation: Selective Fork (tier: advanced)

With 200K-1M context windows, not everything needs forking.

**Fork when** (these rules override `context: fork` declarations):
- Skill reads > 30 files
- Skill generates > 500 lines of output
- Skill connects to external services (MCP, APIs)
- Skill does cross-codebase analysis (consultant, security-reviewer)

**Inline when** (convert fork to shared):
- Skill reads < 15 files in a focused area
- Single-domain, focused analysis on one module
- Quick checks on focused areas

**Skills that ALWAYS fork regardless of tier**:
- consultant (7-layer deep analysis, always heavy)
- security-reviewer (sensitive, isolation is a feature)
- mcp-connector (external services)

**Skills that become inline in selective mode**:
- coverage-checker (when checking single module)

### Implementation: Aggressive Fork (tier: standard, lightweight)

**Fork everything** marked with `context: fork`. This is the existing behavior.

---

## Provider: Coordination

### Interface (What Users See)

```bash
# Always the same commands
/workflows:status user-auth
# Git sync is handled automatically via git-sync skill within plan/work
```

### Implementation: Native + State (tier: advanced)

When Agent Teams is active:
- **In-session**: Direct teammate communication
- **Cross-session**: `tasks.md` (persistent)
- **Conflict resolution**: Orchestrator mediates

### Implementation: State + Git (tier: standard)

The existing behavior:
- All state in `tasks.md`
- Git commits as sync points
- git-sync skill for explicit sharing

---

## Detection Protocol

When a provider-dependent command is invoked, execute this protocol:

```
PROVIDER RESOLUTION PROTOCOL
─────────────────────────────

1. READ core/providers.yaml
   └── Get configured provider for this capability

2. IF provider == "auto":
   │
   ├── CHECK model identity (system prompt)
   │   └── Determine tier: advanced | standard | lightweight
   │
   ├── CHECK tool availability
   │   └── TeammateTool available? Fork available?
   │
   └── SELECT provider based on tier + tools
       └── advanced + TeammateTool → agent-teams
       └── advanced, no TeammateTool → worktrees (with relaxed thresholds)
       └── standard → worktrees
       └── lightweight → worktrees (minimal)

3. IF provider is explicit (not "auto"):
   └── USE specified provider directly

4. APPLY thresholds from providers.yaml
   └── IF threshold is null → use provider defaults
   └── IF threshold has value → override default

5. EXECUTE with resolved provider
   └── Log provider choice for debugging
```

---

## Configuration Guide

### For Opus 4.6 (Maximize New Capabilities)

```yaml
# providers.yaml
providers:
  parallelization: auto        # Will use Agent Teams when available
  context_management: auto     # Will use compaction-aware
  fork_strategy: auto          # Will use selective (less forking)
  coordination: auto           # Will use native-plus-state
```

### For Opus 4.5 (Full Compatibility)

```yaml
# providers.yaml
providers:
  parallelization: worktrees
  context_management: manual-snapshots
  fork_strategy: aggressive
  coordination: state-plus-git
```

### For Mixed Team (Some on 4.6, Some on 4.5)

```yaml
# providers.yaml — use auto for everything
providers:
  parallelization: auto
  context_management: auto
  fork_strategy: auto
  coordination: auto

# Coordination is ALWAYS compatible because tasks.md is shared.
# An Opus 4.6 agent using Agent Teams and an Opus 4.5 agent using
# worktrees can collaborate via the same tasks.md file.
```

---

## Provider: Execution Mode

### Interface (What Users See)

```bash
# Always the same command
/workflows:work user-auth

# Force execution mode
/workflows:work user-auth --exec=agent
/workflows:work user-auth --exec=human
/workflows:work user-auth --exec=hybrid
```

### Implementation: Agent Executes (tier: any model)

The agent IS the engineer. For each task in `tasks.md`:

```
EXECUTION LOOP (per task):
  1. READ task definition (acceptance criteria, SOLID requirements)
  2. READ pattern reference file (from task's "Reference" field)
  3. GENERATE test file FIRST (TDD Red phase)
  4. RUN tests → confirm they fail (expected)
  5. GENERATE implementation following pattern reference
  6. RUN tests (test-runner skill)
  7. IF tests fail → analyze error + fix (BCP, max 10)
  8. CHECK SOLID compliance (solid-analyzer skill)
  9. IF SOLID < threshold → refactor + re-run tests
  10. FIX lint issues (lint-fixer skill)
  11. CHECKPOINT (update tasks.md)
  12. → Next task
```

**Key principle**: The agent uses Claude Code's native Write/Edit tools to generate code. No scaffolding engine needed — Claude already knows how to write code. The plugin provides the **structure** (what to write, in what order, following what patterns).

**Pattern Learning**: Before generating, the agent reads an existing file as reference (e.g., `src/Domain/Entity/Order.php` when creating `User.php`). This is specified in each task's "Reference" field in `tasks.md`.

### Implementation: Human Guided (legacy)

The agent creates detailed task specs and guidance. The human writes code. The agent verifies with test-runner and solid-analyzer. This is the pre-v2.7.0 behavior.

### Implementation: Hybrid

The agent generates code AND tests, but pauses before each checkpoint for human review. The human can:
- **Accept**: Agent continues to next task
- **Modify**: Agent incorporates changes and re-runs tests
- **Reject**: Agent re-generates following human's feedback

### Detection

```
1. READ core/providers.yaml → providers.execution_mode
2. IF "auto":
   │
   ├── Is the task in a LOW trust area (auth/, security/, payment/)?
   │   YES → hybrid (agent generates but human reviews)
   │
   ├── Does the task have a "Reference" file in tasks.md?
   │   YES → agent-executes (pattern exists to follow)
   │
   └── OTHERWISE → agent-executes (default for well-planned tasks)

3. IF explicit → use that mode directly
4. IF --exec flag passed → override (session only)
```

## Model Recommendations by Phase

Not every workflow phase requires the most capable (and expensive) model. Use this matrix to right-size model selection when the API caller supports per-request model switching:

| Phase | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| **Route** | Sonnet / Haiku | Classification task — fast response, low complexity |
| **Shape** | Opus | Exploratory reasoning, ambiguity resolution |
| **Plan (Phase 1-2)** | Opus | Requirements analysis, spec generation |
| **Plan (Phase 3)** | Opus | Architectural design, SOLID reasoning |
| **Plan (Phase 4)** | Sonnet | Task breakdown from established design — structured output |
| **Quality Gates** | Haiku / Sonnet | Checklist verification — simple pass/fail checks |
| **Work (simple tasks)** | Sonnet | Pattern-following implementation with clear reference files |
| **Work (complex tasks)** | Opus | Novel code, multi-layer integration, no reference pattern |
| **Review (code quality)** | Sonnet | Checklist-based verification against criteria |
| **Review (security)** | Opus | Threat analysis requires deep reasoning |
| **Compound** | Sonnet | Structured capture and spec merging |

**How to use**: Configure in `providers.yaml` under `api_recommendations`. When set to `auto`, the plugin suggests the model but the API caller decides. This is a recommendation, not enforcement — the plugin works correctly with any model.

**Fallback**: If only one model is available, use it for all phases. The workflow adapts; these are optimizations, not requirements.

### API Parameter Recommendations by Phase

Beyond model selection, API callers can optimize parameters per phase:

| Phase | `thinking` | `effort` | `speed` | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Route** | disabled | low | fast | Classification is pattern-matching, not reasoning |
| **Shape** | enabled (high budget) | max | normal | Ambiguity resolution benefits from deep reasoning |
| **Plan (Phase 1-2)** | enabled (medium budget) | high | normal | Spec generation needs structured thinking |
| **Plan (Phase 3)** | enabled (high budget) | max | normal | Architectural design needs maximum reasoning depth |
| **Plan (Phase 4)** | enabled (low budget) | medium | fast | Task breakdown from established design |
| **Quality Gates** | disabled | low | fast | Pass/fail checklist verification |
| **Work (simple)** | enabled (low budget) | medium | fast | Pattern-following with clear references |
| **Work (complex)** | enabled (high budget) | max | normal | Novel code, multi-layer integration |
| **Review (code)** | enabled (medium budget) | high | normal | Needs to reason about code quality |
| **Review (security)** | enabled (high budget) | max | normal | Threat analysis requires deep reasoning |
| **Compound** | enabled (low budget) | medium | fast | Structured capture and merging |

### providers.yaml api_recommendations Format

```yaml
# In providers.yaml:
api_recommendations:
  model_per_phase:
    route: sonnet
    shape: opus
    plan_understand: opus
    plan_specs: opus
    plan_design: opus
    plan_tasks: sonnet
    quality_gates: haiku
    work_simple: sonnet
    work_complex: opus
    review_code: sonnet
    review_security: opus
    compound: sonnet

  thinking_per_phase:
    route: disabled
    shape: high
    plan_design: high
    quality_gates: disabled
    work_simple: low
    work_complex: high
    review_security: high

  # These are RECOMMENDATIONS — the plugin works with any model and settings.
  # The API caller reads these values and applies them when making requests.
```

---

## What the Plugin CANNOT Abstract

These are API-level settings controlled by whoever calls the Claude API, not by the plugin:

| Setting | Where It's Set | Plugin's Role |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` | API request parameter | **Recommend** in `providers.yaml` under `api_recommendations` |
| `speed: "fast"` | API request parameter | **Recommend** per task type |
| `effort: "max"` | API request parameter | **Recommend** per workflow phase |
| Compaction API enablement | API/server configuration | **Adapt** thresholds when active |
| 1M context window | API beta flag | **Adapt** fork strategy and thresholds |
| `output_config.format` | API request parameter | **Document** migration path |

The plugin documents optimal API settings in `providers.yaml` under `api_recommendations` so the team can configure their API callers appropriately.

## Adding a New Provider

When a new capability becomes available (e.g., a future Claude 5.0 feature):

1. **Add provider option** to `providers.yaml` with documentation
2. **Add detection rule** to the Detection Protocol (Step 2)
3. **Update this document** with implementation details
4. **Test with `auto`** — ensure graceful fallback when capability unavailable
