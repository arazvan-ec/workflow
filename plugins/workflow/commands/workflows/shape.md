# Multi-Agent Workflow: Shape

The shaping phase bridges the gap between a vague idea and a detailed plan. It forces you to understand the problem before committing to a solution.

## Flow Guard (prerequisite check)

Before executing, verify the flow has been followed:

```
PREREQUISITE CHECK:
  1. Was this request routed via /workflows:route?
     Check: Does openspec/changes/{slug}/00_routing.md exist on disk?
     - YES (file exists): Continue to shaping. Load routing context from file.
     - NO (file missing) but routing context is visible in current conversation:
       Write 00_routing.md retroactively from conversation context, then continue.
     - NO (file missing) and no routing context in conversation:
       STOP. Run /workflows:route first, then return here.

  2. If openspec/changes/{slug}/01_shaped_brief.md exists, is this a continuation?
     - YES + --continue flag: Read the Shaping Progress section in 01_shaped_brief.md,
       resume from last completed phase.
     - YES + no --continue flag: Shaped brief already exists. Confirm re-shaping with user.
     - NO: Fresh start, proceed normally.
```

## Usage

```bash
# Full shaping workflow (recommended for complex features)
/workflows:shape payment-integration

# Quick shaping (skip breadboarding, good for simple features)
/workflows:shape user-preferences --mode=quick

# Continue shaping an existing feature
/workflows:shape payment-integration --continue
```

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--mode` | `full` | `full` includes breadboarding + slicing. `quick` stops after fit check. |
| `--continue` | `false` | Resume shaping for a feature that already has `01_shaped_brief.md` |

## Philosophy

> "Separate the problem from the solution. Iterate on both. Commit to neither until you understand both."

> *Based on Ryan Singer's Shape Up methodology*

Good shaping means:
- Requirements (R) exist independently of any solution
- Multiple solutions (A, B, C) can be compared against the same R
- Unknowns are spiked before committing
- The solution is detailed enough to plan but abstract enough to allow flexibility

## When to Use Shape vs Plan Directly

| Situation | Use Shape? | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Complex new feature | **Yes** | Multiple approaches worth comparing |
| Feature with unclear scope | **Yes** | Need to define boundaries first |
| High-risk change | **Yes** | Wrong direction is expensive |
| Simple bug fix | No | Problem and solution are obvious |
| Well-defined small feature | No | Jump to `/workflows:plan` |
| Refactoring | Maybe | Shape if scope is unclear |

**Rule of thumb**: If you can write the plan in your head, skip shaping. If you're not sure which approach to take, shape first.

## Execution Protocol

### Incremental Persistence (MANDATORY)

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Write `01_shaped_brief.md` to disk after EACH phase completes, not just at the end. The file grows incrementally. This ensures interrupted sessions can resume from the last completed phase.

The `01_shaped_brief.md` file MUST include a **Shaping Progress** section at the top that tracks phase completion:

```markdown
## Shaping Progress
| Phase | Status | Completed At |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Phase 1 (Frame) | COMPLETED | 2026-01-16T14:00:00Z |
| Phase 2 (Requirements) | COMPLETED | 2026-01-16T14:15:00Z |
| Phase 3 (Shape) | IN_PROGRESS | - |
| Phase 4 (Fit Check) | PENDING | - |
| Phase 4b (Dimensional Fit) | PENDING | - |
| Phase 5 (Iterate) | PENDING | - |
| Phase 6 (Breadboard) | PENDING | - |
| Phase 7 (Slice) | PENDING | - |
```

**Write-Then-Advance Rule** (same as planning — see `framework_rules.md` §11):
1. Complete a phase
2. WRITE `01_shaped_brief.md` to disk with the new phase content + updated Shaping Progress
3. VERIFY the file exists and contains the new content (Read tool)
4. ONLY THEN advance to the next phase

### Step 1: Create Workspace

```bash
FEATURE_ID="payment-integration"
mkdir -p openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}
```

### Step 2: Invoke Shaper Skill

```bash
/workflow:shaper "${user_description}"
```

The shaper skill handles Phases 1-5 interactively with the user.

### Step 3: Interactive Iteration

During shaping, the user can use shorthand commands:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `show R` | Display requirements |
| `show A` | Display shape A |
| `show R x A` | Show fit check |
| `spike A2` | Investigate part A2 |
| `add R` | Add requirement |
| `try B` | Create alternative shape |
| `ready?` | Check if ready for next phase |

### Step 4: Breadboard (if --mode=full)

```bash
/workflow:breadboarder ${FEATURE_ID}
```

### Step 5: Slice (if --mode=full)

```bash
/workflow:breadboarder --slice ${FEATURE_ID}
```

### Step 6: Persist Completion and Handoff

When shaping is complete:

1. **Update `01_shaped_brief.md`**: Mark all completed phases in the Shaping Progress section. Set the last phase status to `COMPLETED` with timestamp.
2. **Write `02_breadboard.md` and `03_slices.md`** (if `--mode=full`): Verify each file is written to disk before proceeding.
3. **Verify all output files exist on disk**:
   ```bash
   ls -la openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/01_shaped_brief.md
   # If --mode=full:
   ls -la openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/02_breadboard.md
   ls -la openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/03_slices.md
   ```
4. Summarize shaped brief for the user.
5. Recommend: proceed to `/workflows:plan ${FEATURE_ID}`

## Dimensional Fit (when diagnostic exists)

When `openspec/specs/api-architecture-diagnostic.yaml` exists, evaluate dimensional implications of each shape after the R x A fit check:

| Dimension | Current Profile | Shape A Impact | Shape B Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Source Topology | [current] | [change or "No change"] | [change or "No change"] |
| Dependency Isolation | [current] | [risk level] | [risk level] |
| Concurrency Model | [current] | [change or "No change"] | [change or "No change"] |

**Decision factor**: A shape that stays within current dimensional bounds is lower risk. A shape that increases dimensional complexity requires more architectural investment (AC-01/02/03/04 patterns).

If a shape increases dimensional complexity, document the architectural investment required and flag it in the fit check notes. This is not a failure — it's a cost factor.

---

## Integration with Planning

The shaped brief enriches the planning process:

| Shaping Output | Planning Input |
|----------------|---------------|
| Frame (Problem/Outcome) | Phase 1: Problem Statement |
| Requirements (R) | Phase 2: Functional Specs foundation |
| Shape parts | Phase 3: Solution design starting point |
| Spike findings | Phase 3: Technical context |
| Fit check | Verification that plan covers all R |
| Breadboard | Concrete scope for task breakdown |
| Slices (V1, V2...) | Task groups ordered by priority |

### What Shaping Replaces in Planning

With shaping, the planner can skip or accelerate:
- **Phase 1 (Understand)**: Already done in shaping frame
- **Phase 2 (Specs)**: Requirements provide foundation (but planner still adds formal specs)
- **Phase 3 (Solutions)**: Shape provides direction (planner adds SOLID analysis)

What shaping does NOT replace:
- SOLID compliance analysis
- Integration analysis with existing specs
- Detailed task breakdown
- API contract generation

---

## Shaping Checklist

Before marking shaping as complete:

- [ ] Problem is framed (not just described)
- [ ] Requirements are problem-space, not solution-space
- [ ] At least one shape drafted with concrete mechanisms
- [ ] All flagged unknowns have been spiked
- [ ] Fit check is all green for selected shape
- [ ] User has approved the direction
- [ ] (Full mode) Breadboard shows complete wiring
- [ ] (Full mode) Slices are vertical with demo statements

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Shape for Simple Feature

```
User: "Add user preferences page"

Shape:
  R0: User can view their preferences (Core goal)
  R1: User can edit preferences (Must-have)
  R2: Preferences persist across sessions (Must-have)

  Shape A: Settings page with form
    A1: Preferences form (React form with fields)
    A2: Preferences API (GET/PUT endpoint)
    A3: Preferences storage (database column on User)

  Fit: All green. Ready for /workflows:plan.
```

### Example 2: Full Shape for Complex Feature

```
User: "Integrate Stripe payments"

Shape:
  R0-R8: Payment requirements (checkout, refunds, webhooks, etc.)

  Shape A: Direct Stripe API
    A1: Checkout flow (Stripe Elements)
    A2: Payment processing (Stripe API server-side)
    A3: Webhook handler (Stripe events)
    A4: Refund system [flagged]
    A5: Invoice generation [flagged]

  Spike A4: Stripe refund API is straightforward, partial refunds supported
  Spike A5: Stripe invoices or custom PDF? → Stripe invoices sufficient

  Breadboard: 3 Places (Checkout UI, API Server, Stripe)
              8 UI affordances, 12 Code affordances, 4 Data stores

  Slices:
    V1: One-time payment checkout (demo: buy a product)
    V2: Webhook processing (demo: payment confirmed in DB)
    V3: Refunds (demo: refund from admin panel)
    V4: Invoices (demo: download invoice PDF)
```
