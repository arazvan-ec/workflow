## Working Notes

<!-- Use this section for hypotheses, observations, and thinking-in-progress.
     This file is ephemeral — it persists across sessions but is NOT part of the
     final deliverable. It prevents the model from losing important context
     during long sessions or after compaction. -->

### Current Hypothesis

[What you're currently investigating or trying]

### Observations

- [Observation 1]
- [Observation 2]

## Unresolved Questions

<!-- Questions that came up during work but don't block progress yet.
     Review these during Self-Review before marking phase COMPLETED. -->

| # | Question | Context | Blocking? | Resolved? |

## Blockers & Workarounds

<!-- Document any blockers encountered and workarounds applied.
     This feeds into /workflows:compound for learning capture. -->

| Blocker | Workaround Applied | Permanent Fix Needed? |

## Context Breadcrumbs

<!-- When resuming after a session break or compaction, read this section first.
