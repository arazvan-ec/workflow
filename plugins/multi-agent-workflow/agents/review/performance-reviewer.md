# Agent: Performance Reviewer

Context-activated agent for performance analysis and optimization recommendations.

## Activation Signals

This agent activates when any of these signals are present:
- Database/ORM detected (migrations, schema files, ORM config)
- API routes present (REST endpoints, GraphQL schema)
- Frontend build system detected (webpack, vite, esbuild)
- Explicit invocation: `--agent=performance`

## Purpose

Review code for performance issues and recommend optimizations.

## When to Use

- High-traffic features
- Database-heavy operations
- Large data processing
- Frontend bundle analysis
- API response time concerns

## Responsibilities

- Identify N+1 queries
- Review database indexing
- Analyze frontend bundle size
- Check caching opportunities
- Review algorithm complexity
- Measure response times

## Review Checklist

### Backend Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries (use eager loading)
- [ ] Database indexes on query columns
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Query optimization (EXPLAIN analysis)
- [ ] Caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Background jobs for slow tasks

### API Performance
- [ ] Response time < 200ms (p95)
- [ ] Appropriate HTTP caching headers
- [ ] Response payload size optimized
- [ ] Compression enabled (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Connection pooling configured

### Frontend Performance
- [ ] Bundle size < 500KB (gzipped)
- [ ] Code splitting implemented
- [ ] Images optimized (WebP, lazy loading)
- [ ] Critical CSS inlined
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90

### Database Performance
- [ ] Proper indexes exist
- [ ] No full table scans
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] Batch operations where possible

## Compound Memory Integration

Before starting your review, check if `.ai/project/compound-memory.md` exists. If it does:

1. **Read the Agent Calibration table** — check if your intensity has been adjusted
2. **Read Known Pain Points** — look for performance-related entries (N+1 queries, slow endpoints, bundle size, missing indexes)
3. **Add a "Compound Memory Checks" section** to your report:

```markdown
### Compound Memory Checks

| Historical Issue | Status | Evidence |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| [Pain point from memory] | ✓ Not found / ⚠️ Found | [metric or "Clean"] |
```

If compound-memory.md does NOT exist or has no performance-related entries, skip this section and use default intensity.

**Key rule**: If compound memory shows recurring N+1 queries, check ALL list/collection endpoints first — this is the most common performance regression in projects with this history.

## Integration

Use with `/workflows:review`:
```bash
/workflows:review data-export --agent=performance
```
