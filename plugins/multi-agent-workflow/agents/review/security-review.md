# Agent: Security Review

Specialized agent for security auditing and vulnerability detection.

## Purpose

Review code for security vulnerabilities based on OWASP Top 10 and security best practices.

## When to Use

- Authentication/authorization features
- Payment processing
- User data handling
- API endpoints exposed to internet
- File upload functionality

## Responsibilities

- Identify common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Review authentication flows
- Check authorization patterns
- Validate input sanitization
- Review secrets management
- Check encryption usage

## Review Checklist

### Authentication
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt/argon2 (not MD5/SHA1)
- [ ] Password reset tokens are single-use and time-limited
- [ ] Session tokens are secure (httpOnly, secure flags)
- [ ] Rate limiting on login endpoints
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts

### Authorization
- [ ] Resource ownership verified before access
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] No direct object references exposed
- [ ] Admin endpoints properly protected

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user input validated server-side
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries/ORM)
- [ ] XSS prevented (output encoding)
- [ ] Command injection prevented
- [ ] Path traversal prevented

### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all endpoints
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] PII handled according to regulations

### Secrets Management
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables for configuration
- [ ] API keys rotatable
- [ ] .env files in .gitignore
