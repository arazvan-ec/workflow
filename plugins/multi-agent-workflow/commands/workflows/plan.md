# Multi-Agent Workflow: Plan

The planning phase is the foundation of compound engineering. Invest 80% of effort here.

## Flow Guard (prerequisite check)

Before executing, verify the flow has been followed:

```
PREREQUISITE CHECK:
  1. Was this request routed via /workflows:route?
     - YES: Continue to planning
     - NO: STOP. Run /workflows:route first, then return here.

  2. If tasks.md exists in openspec/changes/{slug}/ for this feature, is this a continuation?
     - YES (planner = IN_PROGRESS): Resume planning from last checkpoint
     - YES (planner = COMPLETED): Plan already exists. Confirm re-planning with user.
     - NO: Fresh start, proceed normally.

  If either check fails, do NOT proceed. Route first.
```

## Usage

```
/workflows:plan user-authentication
/workflows:plan payment-system --workflow=task-breakdown
/workflows:plan order-management --show-impact=true
```

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--workflow` | `default` | Workflow type: `default` or `task-breakdown` |
| `--show-impact` | `true` | Show detailed integration impact analysis |

## Philosophy

> "Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier—not harder"

> "El código de alta calidad cumple SOLID de forma rigurosa"

Good planning means:
- Engineers can start WITHOUT asking questions
- **Solutions are designed with SOLID compliance from the start**
- API contracts are complete enough to mock
- Every task has clear "definition of done"

---

## Quality Gate Protocol (shared by all phases)

Each planning phase ends with a Quality Gate before writing its output file. The protocol is the same; only the specific checks change per phase.

```
QUALITY GATE (max 3 iterations):
  iteration = 0
  while iteration < 3:
    Step 0 (Reflection): Before checking, state 3 things that could be wrong
      with this output. Check specifically for these self-identified risks.

    Run phase-specific checks (see each phase below)

    IF all checks pass → WRITE file, advance to next phase
    IF any check fails → log which failed, revise, iteration += 1

  IF 3 iterations exhausted:
    WRITE best version with "## Quality Warnings" section
    NOTIFY user of concerns
    ADVANCE to next phase (do not block indefinitely)
```

After passing any Quality Gate, follow the Per-Phase Write Directives below.

---

## MANDATORY: Incremental Persistence Protocol

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Every planning phase MUST write its output file to disk IMMEDIATELY upon completion, BEFORE starting the next phase. Planning is NOT an in-memory exercise. If Claude is interrupted at any point, all completed phases must be recoverable from disk.

### The Write-Then-Advance Rule

```
PHASE COMPLETION PROTOCOL (applies to every phase):

1. GENERATE the phase output in full
2. WRITE the output file to disk immediately (use Write tool)
3. UPDATE tasks.md Workflow State with phase completion status + timestamp
4. VERIFY the file exists on disk (use Read tool to confirm)
5. ONLY THEN advance to the next phase

If step 2 fails, RETRY the write. Do NOT proceed to next phase
with unwritten output.
```

### Planning Progress Tracker (in tasks.md Workflow State)

At the START of planning, create `openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/tasks.md` using the canonical template from `core/templates/tasks-template.md`. Set Planner status to IN_PROGRESS and fill in Feature ID and timestamps.

### Per-Phase Write Directives

After completing each phase, apply the Write-Then-Advance Rule:

| Phase | Output File | Extra Steps |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Step 0 | (none — context only) | UPDATE tasks.md: Step 0 → COMPLETED |
| Phase 1 | `proposal.md` | — |
| Phase 2 | `specs.md` | RUN Integration Analysis pre-hook before generating |
| Phase 3 | `design.md` | — |
| Phase 4 | Update `tasks.md` (Progress + Details) | APPEND summary to `proposal.md`, proceed to Completeness Verification |

---

## Shaping Integration (Optional Pre-Phase)

If `/workflows:shape` was run before planning, the following artifacts are available in `openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/`:

| File | Content | How Planner Uses It |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `01_shaped_brief.md` | Frame, requirements (R), shape, fit check | Accelerates Phase 1 (Understand) and Phase 2 (Specs) |
| `02_breadboard.md` | Places, affordances, wiring diagram | Informs Phase 3 (Design) with concrete mechanisms |
| `03_slices.md` | Vertical slices with demo statements | Becomes the task group structure in Phase 4 |
| `spike-*.md` | Technical investigation findings | Provides context for design decisions |

When shaped brief exists, the planner should:
1. **Phase 1**: Use the Frame as the problem statement (verify with user, don't re-derive)
2. **Phase 2**: Use Requirements (R) as foundation for functional specs (add formal structure)
3. **Phase 3**: Use Shape parts as starting point for design (add SOLID analysis)
4. **Phase 4**: Use Slices (V1, V2...) to structure task groups vertically

---

## Planning Depth Resolution

Before starting the planning process, resolve the `planning_depth` provider from `core/providers.yaml`:

```
READ core/providers.yaml → providers.planning_depth

IF "auto":
  ├── Complexity from /workflows:route == "complex" → full
  ├── Complexity from /workflows:route == "medium"  → standard
  └── Complexity from /workflows:route == "simple"  → minimal

IF "full":    Execute ALL phases (Step 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4)
IF "standard": Execute Step 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (skip integration/impact detail) + Phase 4
IF "minimal":  Execute Step 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 4 ONLY (skip Phase 2 specs and Phase 3 solutions)
```

| Depth | Phases | Output Files | Best For |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **full** | All phases + integration + SOLID + impact | proposal, specs, design, tasks | Complex features, multi-layer, security |
| **standard** | Phase 1-4, no detailed impact | proposal, specs, design, tasks | Medium features, single-layer |
| **minimal** | Phase 1 + Phase 4 only | proposal, tasks | Simple features, bug fixes |

When `planning_depth` is `minimal`, the Quality Gates for Phase 2 and Phase 3 are skipped (those phases don't execute).

### Key Distinction

| Phase 2: SPECS | Phase 3: SOLUTIONS |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **QUÉ** debe hacer | **CÓMO** hacerlo |
| Requisitos funcionales | Diseño técnico |
| "User can register" | "Use Strategy pattern for validators" |
| Del usuario/negocio | Del desarrollador/arquitecto |

**SOLID es un CONSTRAINT de diseño en Fase 3, no una spec funcional en Fase 2.**

---

## STEP 0: LOAD PROJECT SPECS (Architecture Context)

Before planning any new feature, load and understand the existing project architecture.

### Step 0.0: Load Implementation Preferences (if exists)

```bash
# Check if pre-planning phase captured preferences
PREFERENCES="openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/01_preferences.md"
if [ -f "$PREFERENCES" ]; then
  echo "Preferences found from pre-planning. Loading into planning context."
  # Read technology choices, architecture preferences, code style, constraints
  # Do NOT re-ask questions already answered in 01_preferences.md
  # Use preferences to guide Phase 1 constraints and Phase 3 design
fi
```

### Step 0.0b: Check for Shaped Brief (if exists)

```bash
# Check if shaping was done before planning
SHAPED_BRIEF="openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/01_shaped_brief.md"
if [ -f "$SHAPED_BRIEF" ]; then
  echo "Shaped brief found. Using as input for planning."
  # Read shaped brief, breadboard, slices
  # Accelerate Phase 1 and Phase 2 with existing context
fi
```

### Step 0.1: Read Existing Specifications

```bash
# Load all existing project specs (BASELINE — read-only, only compound writes here)
SPECS_BASE="openspec/specs"

# Entities - the domain model
ls -la ${SPECS_BASE}/entities/*.yaml

# API Contracts - existing endpoints
ls -la ${SPECS_BASE}/api-contracts/*.yaml

# Business Rules - domain logic constraints
ls -la ${SPECS_BASE}/business-rules/*.yaml

# Architectural Constraints - system boundaries
ls -la ${SPECS_BASE}/architectural-constraints/*.yaml
```

### Step 0.2: Generate and Display Specs Summary

Summarize the loaded specs as a table (entities, endpoints, rules, constraints) and display to the user when `--show-impact=true`. This establishes the architecture context before planning begins.

---

## PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND (Entender el Problema)

### Step 1.1: Analyze the Request

```markdown
## Request Analysis

**Original Request**: [user's exact words]
**Request Type**: [feature | refactor | bugfix | architecture | investigation]
**Affected Areas**: [modules/services involved]
**Confidence Level**: [0-100%]
```

### Step 1.2: Ask Clarifying Questions (if confidence < 60%)

Before proceeding, ensure you understand:

| Question Category | Example Questions |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Functional Scope** | ¿Qué debe hacer exactamente? ¿Qué NO debe hacer? |
| **Users/Actors** | ¿Quién usará esta funcionalidad? |
| **Integration** | ¿Se conecta con APIs externas? ¿Qué sistemas afecta? |
| **Constraints** | ¿Hay restricciones de tiempo/tecnología/rendimiento? |
| **Success Criteria** | ¿Cómo sabremos que está completo y funciona? |

### Step 1.3: Document the Understood Problem

```markdown
## Problem Statement

### What We're Building
[Clear description of the feature/task]

### Why It's Needed
[Business justification]

### Who Benefits
[Users/stakeholders]

### Constraints
- Technical: [stack, performance, integrations]
- Business: [timeline, budget, compliance]
- Team: [skills, availability]

### Success Criteria
1. [Measurable criterion 1]
2. [Measurable criterion 2]
```

### Phase 1 Quality Gate

Apply the Quality Gate Protocol (above) with these 4 checks before writing `proposal.md`:

1. **Specific to request**: References user's exact words/intent. FAIL if generic/templated.
2. **Substantive content**: ≥10 non-header content lines. FAIL if only section headers.
3. **Measurable criteria**: Each success criterion is testable (pass/fail). FAIL if vague.
4. **Complete coverage**: All aspects of user's request addressed. FAIL if significant gaps.

---

## PHASE 2: SPECS (Requisitos Funcionales)

Phase 2 defines **WHAT** the system must do - the functional requirements from the user's perspective.

### Functional Specs Only

```markdown
## Functional Specs: ${FEATURE_ID}

### SPEC-F01: [Functional Requirement 1]
**Description**: [What it must do - from user perspective]
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Testable criterion]
- [ ] [Testable criterion]
**Verification**: [How to test]

### SPEC-F02: [Functional Requirement 2]
**Description**: [What it must do]
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Testable criterion]
**Verification**: [How to test]

### SPEC-F03: [Functional Requirement 3]
...
```

### Examples of Good Specs (Functional)

| Good Spec (QUÉ) | Bad Spec (CÓMO) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "User can register with email and password" | "Use Strategy pattern" |
| "System validates email format" | "Create EmailValidator class" |
| "Login returns authentication token" | "Implement Repository pattern" |
| "Password must be ≥8 characters" | "Use DIP for dependencies" |

**Note**: SOLID, patterns, and technical decisions belong in Phase 3, not here.

### How to Generate Specs

```bash
# Generate functional specs interactively
/workflow-skill:criteria-generator --feature=${FEATURE_ID} --interview

# Output: openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/specs.md
```

### Integration Analysis (when --show-impact=true)

After defining functional specs, analyze how they integrate with existing specs.

#### Step 2.A: Identify Integration Points

```markdown
## Integration Analysis: ${FEATURE_ID}

### Entities Impact

#### EXTENDED (existing entities with new properties/methods)
| Entity | New Property/Method | Reason |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| User | `subscription_tier` | Support premium features |
| Order | `discount_applied` | Apply subscription discounts |

#### MODIFIED (existing entities with changed behavior)
| Entity | Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| User | Validation rules | Add tier validation |

#### NEW (entities created by this feature)
| Entity | Purpose | Relationships |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Subscription | Track user subscription | belongs_to: User |
| SubscriptionPlan | Define available plans | has_many: Subscriptions |

### API Contracts Impact

#### EXTENDED (existing endpoints with new parameters/responses)
| Endpoint | Change | Backward Compatible |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| GET /api/users/{id} | Add `subscription` to response | YES |
| POST /api/orders | Accept `discount_code` param | YES |

#### MODIFIED (existing endpoints with changed behavior)
| Endpoint | Change | Migration Required |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| None | - | - |

#### NEW (endpoints created by this feature)
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| /api/subscriptions | GET, POST | Subscription CRUD |
| /api/subscription-plans | GET | List available plans |

### Business Rules Impact

#### CONFLICTS (potential conflicts with existing rules)
| New Rule | Existing Rule | Resolution |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| "Premium users get 20% discount" | BR-001 "Order total > 0" | Check after discount |

#### NEW (business rules added by this feature)
| Rule ID | Entity | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| BR-010 | Subscription | Active subscription required for premium features |
| BR-011 | Order | Discount cannot exceed 50% of order total |
```

#### Step 2.B: API Contract Design (for new/modified endpoints)

When the feature introduces new API endpoints or modifies existing ones, apply these conventions:

```
API CONTRACT DESIGN PROTOCOL:

1. NAMING: RESTful resource-based URLs
   - Resources are nouns, plural: /api/users, /api/orders
   - Nested resources for relationships: /api/users/{id}/orders
   - Actions as sub-resources when CRUD doesn't fit: /api/orders/{id}/cancel

2. CONTRACT DEFINITION: For each new/modified endpoint, specify:
   - Method + Path
   - Request: headers, path params, query params, body schema
   - Response: status codes (success + error), body schema
   - Authentication: required/optional, token type
   - Rate limiting: if applicable

3. CONSISTENCY: Match existing project conventions
   - Read existing API contracts in openspec/specs/api-contracts/
   - Follow the same response envelope format
   - Use consistent error response structure
   - Match pagination style (cursor vs offset)

4. VERSIONING: Follow project's versioning strategy
   - If existing endpoints use /api/v1/, new endpoints must too
   - If no versioning exists, don't introduce it unnecessarily

5. OUTPUT: Include contracts in specs.md Integration Analysis section
```

#### Step 2.C: Conflict Detection

Before proceeding to Phase 3, verify no unresolved conflicts:

```bash
# Check for spec conflicts
/workflow-skill:spec-analyzer --feature=${FEATURE_ID} --check-conflicts

# Output:
# ✅ No entity name conflicts
# ✅ No endpoint path conflicts
# ⚠️ 1 business rule conflict (BR-001 vs new discount rule)
# Action: Resolve conflict before proceeding
```

### Phase 2 Quality Gate

Apply the Quality Gate Protocol (above) with these 4 checks before writing `specs.md`:

1. **WHAT not HOW**: Each spec describes functional requirements. FAIL if contains implementation details.
2. **Testable criteria**: ≥2 acceptance criteria per spec, each verifiable. FAIL if missing or vague.
3. **Full scope**: Every user requirement maps to at least one spec. FAIL if gaps.
4. **Substantive integration**: Integration analysis identifies extended/modified/new entities AND endpoints. FAIL if all say "None" for non-trivial feature.

---

### HITL Checkpoint: Phase 2 → Phase 3

Before proceeding to design, present the spec summary to the user:

```
"Specs complete for ${FEATURE_ID}:
 - ${N} functional specs defined
 - Integration: ${E} entities extended, ${M} modified, ${C} new
 - ${X} API endpoints affected

 Do these specs cover your requirements? [yes / adjust / restart]"
```

If "adjust": revise specs based on feedback, re-run Phase 2 Quality Gate.
If "restart": return to Phase 1 with new understanding.

---

## PHASE 3: DESIGN

Phase 3 defines **HOW** to implement each spec. This is where **SOLID becomes mandatory**.

### The SOLID Constraint

> ⚠️ **MANDATORY CONSTRAINT**: All solutions MUST comply with SOLID principles.
>
> This is NOT optional. Every solution designed in Phase 3 must:
> 1. Be analyzed for SOLID compliance per principle
> 2. Use appropriate design patterns
> 3. Achieve COMPLIANT to proceed, NEEDS_WORK requires revision, NON_COMPLIANT blocks

### Step 3.1: Analyze Existing Code (SOLID Baseline)

Before designing solutions, understand the current state:

```bash
# Get SOLID baseline of affected areas
/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer --mode=baseline --path=src/relevant-module

# Output:
# - Patterns detected in module: [list]
# - Violations found: [list]
# - Principles most relevant to this module: [list]
# - Recommended patterns: [list]
```

### Step 3.2: Design Solutions with SOLID

For EACH functional spec, propose a solution that complies with SOLID:

```markdown
## Solutions: ${FEATURE_ID}

---

### Solution for SPEC-F01: User Registration

**Approach**: Create User entity with email validation

**SOLID Compliance**:
- **SRP**: COMPLIANT — User entity only holds data, validation logic isolated in Email ValueObject
- **OCP**: COMPLIANT — New validators can be added without modifying User (Strategy pattern)
- **LSP**: N/A — No inheritance hierarchy in this solution
- **ISP**: COMPLIANT — Small, focused interfaces for repository and validation
- **DIP**: COMPLIANT — Repository interface defined in Domain, implemented in Infrastructure

**Files to Create**:
- `Domain/Entity/User.php` (SRP: only user data)
- `Domain/ValueObject/Email.php` (SRP: email rules)
- `Domain/Repository/UserRepositoryInterface.php` (DIP: abstraction)
- `Infrastructure/Repository/DoctrineUserRepository.php` (DIP: implementation)

---

### Solution for SPEC-F02: User Login

**Approach**: Authentication service with token generation

**SOLID Compliance**:
- **SRP**: COMPLIANT — Auth logic separate from token generation (Extract Class)
- **OCP**: COMPLIANT — Token strategies can be added without modification (Strategy pattern)
- **LSP**: N/A — No inheritance hierarchy in this solution
- **ISP**: COMPLIANT — Token generator interface is minimal and focused
- **DIP**: COMPLIANT — Token generator injected via interface (DI)

**Files to Create**:
- `Application/Service/AuthenticationService.php`
- `Domain/Service/TokenGeneratorInterface.php`
- `Infrastructure/Service/JwtTokenGenerator.php`
```

### Step 3.3: Pattern Selection Guide

When designing solutions, select patterns based on the need:

| If You Need... | Use Pattern | SOLID Addressed |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Multiple behaviors/algorithms | **Strategy** | OCP, SRP |
| Add functionality without modification | **Decorator** | OCP, SRP |
| Abstract object creation | **Factory Method** | DIP, OCP |
| Integrate external systems | **Adapter / Ports & Adapters** | DIP, OCP |
| Abstract data persistence | **Repository** | SRP, DIP |
| Chain of processing steps | **Chain of Responsibility** | SRP, OCP |
| Encapsulate validation rules | **Value Object** | SRP |
| Decouple layers | **Dependency Injection** | DIP |

See `core/architecture-reference.md` for complete mapping. Consult openspec/specs/architecture-profile.yaml for project patterns.

### Step 3.4: Verify SOLID Compliance

Before finalizing the plan:

```bash
# Validate proposed design against SOLID principles
/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer --mode=design --design=design.md

# Gate logic:
# - COMPLIANT → proceed to implementation
# - NEEDS_WORK → revise design before proceeding
# - NON_COMPLIANT → blocked, requires redesign
```

### SOLID Verdict Gate

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| All relevant principles COMPLIANT | ✅ Approve — proceed to implementation |
| Any principle NEEDS_WORK | ⚠️ Revise — address noted concerns before proceeding |
| Any principle NON_COMPLIANT | ❌ Blocked — redesign required for non-compliant principles |
| Principles marked N/A | ✅ Acceptable — with justification for why principle does not apply |

### Step 3.5: Architectural Impact Analysis (when --show-impact=true)

After designing solutions, analyze the architectural impact across the codebase.

#### Layers Affected

```markdown
## Architectural Impact: ${FEATURE_ID}

### Layer Analysis

| Layer | Impact Level | Changes Required |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **Domain** | HIGH | 2 new entities, 1 extended |
| **Application** | MEDIUM | 3 new use cases |
| **Infrastructure** | MEDIUM | 2 new repositories |
| **Presentation/API** | LOW | 2 new endpoints |

### Affected Layers Diagram

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| User entity changes break existing tests | MEDIUM | HIGH | Run full test suite before merge |
| Payment gateway integration issues | LOW | HIGH | Use sandbox environment |
| Migration conflicts | LOW | MEDIUM | Coordinate with team |
```

### Phase 3 Quality Gate

Apply the Quality Gate Protocol (above) with these 4 checks before writing `design.md`:

1. **Spec coverage**: Every spec from Phase 2 has a corresponding solution. FAIL if any spec lacks one.
2. **Concrete files**: Each solution lists actual file paths to create/modify. FAIL if abstract ("implement a service").
3. **SOLID verdicts**: Each relevant principle has a reasoned verdict (COMPLIANT/N_A with justification). FAIL if missing reasoning.
4. **Architectural impact**: Lists specific layers and files to CREATE and MODIFY. FAIL if empty or "TBD".

## Task Template (includes SOLID)

Each task must include SOLID requirements:

```markdown
### Task BE-001: Create User Entity

**Role**: Backend Engineer
**Methodology**: TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)

**Functional Requirement** (from SPEC-F01):
- User entity with id, email, name, password

**SOLID Requirements** (from solution design):
- **SRP**: Entity only holds data, no business logic
- **DIP**: No infrastructure imports in Entity
- **Pattern**: Value Object for Email

**Tests to Write FIRST**:
- [ ] test_user_can_be_created_with_valid_data()
- [ ] test_email_value_object_validates_format()

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Entity in src/Domain/Entity/
- [ ] Value Object in src/Domain/ValueObject/
- [ ] Architecture: Follow project patterns, SOLID compliance required per solid-analyzer
- [ ] No Doctrine imports in Domain

**Reference**: src/Domain/Entity/Order.php (existing pattern)
```

## Planning Checklist

Before marking planning as COMPLETED, verify each phase delivered its key outputs:

| Phase | Must Have |
|-------|----------|
| Step 0 | Existing specs loaded, architecture context understood |
| Phase 1 | Problem documented, constraints identified, clarifications asked |
| Phase 2 | Testable specs (WHAT not HOW), EXTENDED/MODIFIED/NEW entities + endpoints, conflicts resolved |
| Phase 3 | SOLID baseline analyzed, patterns selected, all principles COMPLIANT, layers + modules + files documented |
| Final | Engineer can start WITHOUT asking questions, integration with existing code is clear |

**If SOLID is not addressed in Phase 3, the plan is INCOMPLETE.**
**If integration analysis is missing, the plan treats feature as ISOLATED (anti-pattern).**

---

## Plan Completeness Verification (MANDATORY before marking COMPLETED)

Before setting planner status to `COMPLETED`, verify:

1. **Files exist**: All 4 output files (`proposal.md`, `specs.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) exist in `openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/`. If missing → generate them. Do NOT mark COMPLETED with missing files.
2. **Substantive content**: Each file has ≥5 non-header content lines. If insufficient → enrich and rewrite.
3. **Cross-reference**: Every user requirement maps to ≥1 spec, every spec maps to ≥1 task. If gaps found → ask user whether to add them.
4. **User confirmation**: Present summary (spec count, task count, files to create/modify, SOLID status). Ask: "Ready for /workflows:work? (yes/review/revise)"
5. **Mark COMPLETED**: Update tasks.md Workflow State → Planner: COMPLETED, all phases COMPLETED with timestamps.

---

## Output Files

### OpenSpec Structure (all workflows):
```
openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/
├── proposal.md   # Phase 1: Problem statement, motivation, scope, success criteria
├── specs.md      # Phase 2: Functional specs (WHAT) + Integration Analysis
├── design.md     # Phase 3: Solutions + SOLID + Architectural Impact (HOW)
└── tasks.md      # Phase 4: Task breakdown + verify conditions + Workflow State
```

The structure for `specs.md` and `design.md` is defined inline in Phase 2 and Phase 3 respectively.

## Summary: Architecture-First Planning

| Step/Phase | Content | Output File | SOLID? | Integration? |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| **Step 0: Load Specs** | Existing architecture context | (context only) | ❌ No | ✅ **YES - CONTEXT** |
| Phase 1: Understand | Problem statement | `proposal.md` | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Phase 2: Specs** | Functional requirements (WHAT) | `specs.md` | ❌ No | ✅ **YES - ANALYSIS** |
| **Phase 3: Design** | Technical design (HOW) | `design.md` | ✅ **YES - MANDATORY** | ✅ **YES - IMPACT** |
| Phase 4: Tasks | Task breakdown + verify + state | `tasks.md` | ❌ No | ❌ No |

**SOLID is a design CONSTRAINT in Phase 3, not a functional SPEC in Phase 2.**

**Integration analysis ensures every feature is designed as an EXTENSION of existing architecture, not an isolated solution.**

### The Integration Mindset

```
❌ WRONG: "I'll create a new User service for authentication"
✅ RIGHT: "I'll EXTEND the existing architecture with User entity,
          MODIFY Order to require auth, and CREATE 3 new endpoints"
```

Every planning session should answer:
1. What EXISTING specs will this feature EXTEND?
2. What EXISTING specs will this feature MODIFY?
3. What NEW specs will this feature CREATE?
4. Are there any CONFLICTS with existing specs?
5. What is the ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT (layers, modules, files)?
