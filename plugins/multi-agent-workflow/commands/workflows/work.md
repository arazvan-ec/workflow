# Multi-Agent Workflow: Work

Execute implementation with the compound engineering principle: make each unit of work easier.

## Flow Guard (prerequisite check)

Before executing, verify the flow has been followed:

```
PREREQUISITE CHECK:
  1. Does tasks.md exist for this feature?
     - NO: STOP. Run /workflows:plan first.

  2. Is planner status = COMPLETED in tasks.md?
     - NO (PENDING or IN_PROGRESS): STOP. Planning not finished. Run /workflows:plan.
     - NO (BLOCKED): STOP. Planning is blocked. Resolve blocker first.
     - YES: Continue to work.

  3. Does the role's status allow starting work?
     - PENDING: OK, start work (set to IN_PROGRESS)
     - IN_PROGRESS: OK, resume work from last checkpoint
     - COMPLETED: Work already done. Confirm re-work with user.
     - BLOCKED: Show blocker details, ask user how to proceed.

  If checks 1 or 2 fail, do NOT proceed. Plan first.
```

## Automatic Operations (built into this command)

The following are executed automatically as part of `/workflows:work`:
- **Git sync** (Step 2) -- pulls latest changes before starting
- **Solution Validation** (Step 4.5) -- validates approach before TDD cycle
- **TDD enforcement** (Step 5) -- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **SOLID verification** (Step 7) -- checks compliance at each checkpoint via solid-analyzer
- **Bounded Correction Protocol** (Step 6) -- auto-corrects with scale-adaptive limits
- **Checkpoint** (Step 7) -- saves progress + commits after each logical unit
- **Snapshot** -- triggered when context exceeds 70% capacity

You do NOT need to invoke these separately.

## Usage

```bash
# Default (sequential tasks from tasks.md)
/workflows:work user-auth

# By Layer (DDD)
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=layers --layer=domain
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=layers --layer=application
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=layers --layer=infrastructure

# By Stack (parallel backend/frontend)
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=stacks --stack=backend
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=stacks --stack=frontend
```

## Execution Mode Resolution

Before executing tasks, resolve the execution mode:

` ` `
1. READ core/providers.yaml → providers.execution_mode

2. IF "auto":
   ├── Is the task in a LOW trust area (auth/, security/, payment/)?
   │   YES → hybrid (agent generates, human reviews)
   │
   ├── Does the task have a "Reference" file in tasks.md?
   │   YES → agent-executes (pattern exists to follow)
   │
   └── OTHERWISE → agent-executes (default)

3. IF --exec flag passed → override (session only)
` ` `

### Agent Executes (default)

The agent generates code following the plan. For each task in `tasks.md`:

` ` `
TASK EXECUTION LOOP:
  1. READ task (acceptance criteria, SOLID requirements, reference file)
  2. READ reference file to learn existing pattern
  3. WRITE test FIRST (TDD Red) — Write tool creates test file
  4. RUN tests → confirm failure (test-runner)
  5. WRITE implementation following pattern — Write/Edit tools
  6. RUN tests (test-runner)
  7. IF fail → analyze + fix (BCP, max 10 iterations)
  8. CHECK SOLID (solid-analyzer --mode=verify) — must be COMPLIANT
  9. FIX lint (lint-fixer)
  10. CHECKPOINT → update tasks.md
  11. → Next task
` ` `

### Human Guided

The agent presents each task with detailed instructions. The human implements. The agent verifies with test-runner and solid-analyzer.

### Hybrid

Same as agent-executes, but pauses before each checkpoint:
` ` `
After step 9 (lint fixed, tests passing):
  → Present generated code to human
  → Wait for: [Accept] [Modify] [Reject]
  → Accept: proceed to checkpoint
  → Modify: incorporate changes, re-run tests
  → Reject: regenerate with human feedback
` ` `

## Task Isolation Mode (Fresh Context per Task)

Resolve task isolation from `--isolation` flag or `fork_strategy` provider:

```
1. IF --isolation=task flag passed → per-task isolation
2. ELSE IF fork_strategy == "per-task" in providers.yaml → per-task isolation
3. ELSE → session isolation (default, all tasks in one context)
```

### Per-Task Isolation (`--isolation=task`)

Inspired by GSD's "fresh context per task" pattern. Each task in `tasks.md` executes in its own isolated subagent context, preventing context rot on long sessions.

```
PER-TASK ISOLATION PROTOCOL:

FOR each task in tasks.md:
  1. LAUNCH Task subagent (context: fork) with ONLY:
     - Role definition (implementer.md)
     - Task definition from tasks.md
     - Reference files listed in the task
     - design.md (for SOLID patterns to follow)
     → 200K tokens purely for this task, zero accumulated context

  2. Subagent executes:
     - TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)
     - Bounded Correction Protocol (scale-adaptive limits)
     - SOLID verification

  3. Subagent returns summary:
     - Files created/modified
     - Tests: X passing, Y% coverage
     - SOLID: COMPLIANT/NEEDS_WORK (per-principle details)
     - Issues encountered (if any)

  4. Main agent:
     - Atomic git commit for this task
     - UPDATE tasks.md with task completion
     - Verify subagent output meets acceptance criteria
     - Launch next task with fresh context

BENEFITS:
  - No context degradation across tasks
  - Each task gets maximum available tokens
  - Individual task commits enable git bisect
  - Failed tasks don't pollute context for subsequent tasks

TRADE-OFFS:
  - Higher total token consumption (~30-50% more)
  - Subagent doesn't see changes from previous tasks (reads from disk)
  - Setup overhead per task (~5 seconds)

BEST FOR:
  - Features with 10+ tasks
  - Sessions expected to exceed 2 hours
  - When quality degradation is observed in later tasks
```

### Session Isolation (default, `--isolation=session`)

Standard behavior: all tasks execute in the same context window. The Bounded Correction Protocol, TDD, and checkpoints operate within a single session. Use context management thresholds from `providers.yaml` to manage context exhaustion.

---

## Parallelization Modes

### Mode: Layers (DDD)
```
Domain + Application + Infrastructure (can run parallel)
```

**Layers available**: `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`

**Best for**:
- Complex business logic
- Backend-heavy features
- DDD architecture compliance

### Mode: Stacks
```
Backend complete + Frontend complete (parallel)
```

**Stacks available**: `backend`, `frontend`

**Best for**:
- Independent features
- Separate deployment pipelines
- Large features with clear boundaries

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Context

```bash
# Load implementer role + mode-specific context
--mode=layers --layer=domain → Read: core/roles/implementer.md + core/rules/framework_rules.md
--mode=stacks --stack=backend → Read: core/roles/implementer.md (backend tasks)
--mode=stacks --stack=frontend → Read: core/roles/implementer.md (frontend tasks)
(default, no mode) → Read: core/roles/implementer.md (all tasks sequentially)
```

### Step 2: Git Sync

```bash
git pull origin feature/${FEATURE_ID} || git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Load Feature Context

```bash
Read: openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/tasks.md      # Tasks + Workflow State
Read: openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/proposal.md    # Problem + success criteria
Read: openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/design.md      # Solutions + SOLID patterns
```

### Step 4: Verify Prerequisites

**For Roles mode**:
- Check Planner status is COMPLETED
- If frontend stack: Check if backend API ready or mock needed

**For Layers mode**:
- Domain: Can start immediately
- Application: Domain should be COMPLETED (or mock)
- Infrastructure: Application should be COMPLETED

### Step 4.5: Solution Validation (Pre-Implementation Check)

Before starting the TDD cycle for each task, validate the approach is sound:

```
SOLUTION VALIDATION (for each task in tasks.md):

1. REFERENCE CHECK: Does a reference file exist for this task?
   - YES: Read reference file. Confirm approach follows the same pattern.
   - NO: Check design.md for architectural guidance. Confirm alignment.

2. INTEGRATION CHECK: Will this conflict with completed checkpoints?
   - Read completed checkpoints in tasks.md
   - Verify interfaces match (DTO shapes, method signatures, API contracts)
   - If conflict detected → STOP. Consult planner before proceeding.

3. DECISION CHECK: Is approach consistent with DECISIONS.md?
   - Read DECISIONS.md for relevant architectural decisions
   - If approach contradicts a decision → STOP. Consult planner.

4. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT: Resolve max_iterations for this task
   - Read task complexity from tasks.md (or infer from scope)
   - Set max_iterations from providers.yaml correction_limits
   - simple: 5, moderate: 10, complex: 15

If ALL checks pass → proceed to TDD (Step 5)
If ANY check fails → escalate to planner with specific conflict details
```

This step prevents wasting TDD iterations on an architecturally flawed approach.

### Step 5: Execute with TDD + SOLID

Execution behavior depends on the resolved execution mode (see Execution Mode Resolution above).

**In `agent-executes` mode** (default), the agent performs all steps autonomously following the Task Execution Loop. The TDD cycle is executed directly by the agent using Write, Edit, and tool invocations.

**In `human-guided` mode**, the agent presents each task with detailed instructions, acceptance criteria, and reference patterns. The human engineer performs the TDD cycle manually. The agent verifies results with test-runner and solid-analyzer after each task.

**In `hybrid` mode**, the agent executes autonomously but pauses before each checkpoint for human review (Accept / Modify / Reject).

Regardless of mode, follow the TDD cycle for each task, ensuring SOLID compliance:

```
1. 🔴 RED: Write test FIRST (must fail)
2. 🟢 GREEN: Write minimum code to pass
3. 🔵 REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green
4. ✅ SOLID: Verify code follows SOLID patterns from design.md
```

**SOLID Verification During Implementation**:

```bash
# After each logical unit, verify SOLID compliance
/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer --mode=verify --path=src/modified-path --design=design.md

# Must be COMPLIANT. If NEEDS_WORK, refactor before proceeding. If NON_COMPLIANT, enter BCP correction loop.
```

### Step 6: Bounded Auto-Correction Protocol + Diagnostic Escalation

Detects and corrects three types of deviations, with intelligent escalation for recurring errors:

```python
iterations = 0
MAX_ITERATIONS = 10  # Resolved from providers.yaml correction_limits
same_error_count = 0
last_error = None

while (tests_failing or deviation_detected) and iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS:
    error = classify_deviation()

    # Track repeated errors for diagnostic escalation
    if error_matches(error, last_error):
        same_error_count += 1
    else:
        same_error_count = 0
        last_error = error

    # DIAGNOSTIC ESCALATION: After 3 consecutive same errors,
    # invoke diagnostic-agent instead of brute-force retry
    if same_error_count >= 3:
        diagnosis = invoke_diagnostic_agent(
            error=error,
            attempts_log=attempts_log,
            task_context=current_task
        )
        # context: fork — agent runs in isolated context

        if diagnosis.confidence == "LOW":
            document_blocker(include_diagnostic=diagnosis)
            mark_blocked()
            break

        apply_diagnostic_recommendation(diagnosis)
        same_error_count = 0  # reset after new approach
    else:
        # Standard deviation-type handling
        if TYPE_1_TEST_FAILURE:
            analyze_error()
            fix_code()          # NEVER fix the test
        elif TYPE_2_MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY:
            compare_vs_acceptance_criteria()  # from tasks.md
            add_missing_implementation()
        elif TYPE_3_INCOMPLETE_PATTERN:
            compare_vs_reference_file()       # from task definition
            complete_pattern()

    run_verification()    # tests + acceptance criteria check
    iterations += 1

if all_verified:
    checkpoint_complete()
elif not is_blocked:
    document_blocker(deviation_type, attempts_per_type)
    mark_blocked()
```

**Deviation Types:**
- **TYPE 1 — Test Failure**: Tests fail → fix implementation
- **TYPE 2 — Missing Functionality**: Tests pass but acceptance criteria unmet → add implementation
- **TYPE 3 — Incomplete Pattern**: Implementation doesn't follow reference file → complete pattern

**Diagnostic escalation**: When the same error recurs 3 times, the `diagnostic-agent` (see `agents/workflow/diagnostic-agent.md`) runs in a forked context to analyze root cause and recommend a different approach. This prevents wasting iterations on the same failing fix.

### Step 7: Checkpoint (includes SOLID + Goal Verification)

After each logical unit:

```bash
# 1. Verify SOLID compliance
/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer --mode=verify --path=src/modified-path --design=design.md

# 2. Goal-Backward Verification (from GSD Verify)
# Verify against acceptance criteria, not just test results
```

**Goal-Backward Verification** (tests passing is necessary but NOT sufficient):

```
GOAL VERIFICATION (after tests pass):
  1. Read acceptance criteria for current task from tasks.md
  2. For each criterion:
     - AUTOMATED: If testable via command → run command → verify output
     - OBSERVABLE: If requires code inspection → read files → verify behavior exists
     - MANUAL: If requires human verification → document what to verify
  3. Score: X/Y criteria verified

  If all criteria verified → proceed to checkpoint
  If any criterion FAILED → re-enter correction loop (TYPE 2 deviation)
  If any criterion MANUAL → add PENDING_REVIEW to checkpoint notes
```

```bash
# 3. Only checkpoint if SOLID + goal verification pass
/multi-agent-workflow:checkpoint ${ROLE} ${FEATURE_ID} "Completed ${UNIT}"
```

**Checkpoint SOLID Requirements**:

Gate: no principle may be NON_COMPLIANT. NEEDS_WORK triggers refactor before proceeding.

| Checkpoint Type | Verification |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Domain layer | solid-analyzer --mode=verify --path=src/Domain --design=design.md |
| Application layer | solid-analyzer --mode=verify --path=src/Application --design=design.md |
| Infrastructure | solid-analyzer --mode=verify --path=src/Infrastructure --design=design.md |
| Full feature | solid-analyzer --mode=verify --path=src --design=design.md --scope=full |

## Stack-Specific Workflows

```

## State Updates

Update `tasks.md` at each checkpoint:

```markdown
## Implementer
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**Checkpoint**: Domain layer complete
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-16T14:30:00Z
**Tests**: 15/15 passing, 92% coverage
**SOLID**: COMPLIANT (SRP: ✓, OCP: ✓, LSP: N/A, ISP: ✓, DIP: ✓)
**Iterations**: 3

### Resume Information
- **Completed**: User entity, Email VO
- **Next Task**: CreateUserUseCase (BE-005)
- **Files to Read on Resume**:
  - tasks.md (Task BE-005)
  - src/Domain/Entity/User.php
- **SOLID**: COMPLIANT (SRP: ✓, OCP: ✓, LSP: N/A, ISP: ✓, DIP: ✓)
```

## Per-Task State Persistence (MANDATORY)

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Update `tasks.md` after completing EACH individual task, not just at checkpoints. If a session is interrupted between tasks, the resume point must be documented.

After completing each task in `tasks.md`:

```
PER-TASK UPDATE PROTOCOL:

1. Mark the task as COMPLETED in tasks.md task tracker
2. Record the timestamp (ISO 8601)
3. Update the "Resume Point" section with the NEXT task
4. WRITE tasks.md to disk immediately

This happens BEFORE the checkpoint (which includes git commit).
Even if no checkpoint is triggered, the state file is updated.
```

### Task-Level State Tracker (in tasks.md)

```markdown
## Implementer
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**Last Updated**: ${ISO_TIMESTAMP}

### Task Progress
| Task ID | Description | Status | Completed At |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| BE-001 | Create User Entity | COMPLETED | 2026-01-16T14:00:00Z |
| BE-002 | Create Email VO | COMPLETED | 2026-01-16T14:15:00Z |
| BE-003 | Create UserRepository Interface | IN_PROGRESS | - |
| BE-004 | CreateUserUseCase | PENDING | - |
| BE-005 | POST /api/users endpoint | PENDING | - |

### Resume Point
**Last Completed Task**: BE-002 (Create Email VO)
**Currently Working On**: BE-003 (Create UserRepository Interface)
**Next Task After Current**: BE-004 (CreateUserUseCase)
**Files to Read on Resume**:
  - openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/tasks.md (Task BE-003)
  - src/Domain/Entity/User.php (reference for repository)
**Last Save**: 2026-01-16T14:15:00Z
```

### Interrupted Session Recovery

When resuming a session (detected by reading `tasks.md` with status `IN_PROGRESS`):

```
RESUME PROTOCOL:
1. Read tasks.md → identify Resume Point
2. Read the "Currently Working On" task from tasks.md
3. Read "Files to Read on Resume" list
4. Check git status for uncommitted changes
5. Continue from the identified task

DO NOT restart from the beginning.
DO NOT re-do completed tasks.
```

### State Update Timing

```
WHEN to update tasks.md:

1. After EACH task completion (even if not a checkpoint)
   → Update: task status, timestamp, resume point
   → Cost: ~5 seconds, prevents hours of lost work

2. At EACH checkpoint (logical unit boundary)
   → Update: full checkpoint details, SOLID compliance, tests
   → Also: git commit

3. Before ANY pause or break
   → Update: resume point with current context
   → This is the minimum for session recovery

ALWAYS include "Last Save" timestamp in tasks.md.
Format: ISO 8601 (e.g., 2026-01-16T14:30:00Z)
```

## Escape Hatch

If blocked after max iterations:

```markdown
## Blocker: [Task Name]

**Deviation type**: TYPE 1 | TYPE 2 | TYPE 3
**Iterations attempted**: [N] (Type 1: X, Type 2: Y, Type 3: Z)
**Last error/gap**: [exact error or unmet criterion]

**What was tried per deviation type**:
- TYPE 1 (test failures): [approaches tried]
- TYPE 2 (missing functionality): [gaps identified and attempted]
- TYPE 3 (incomplete patterns): [reference comparisons made]

**Root cause hypothesis**: [Why failing]

**Suggested alternatives**:
1. [Alternative 1]
2. [Alternative 2]

**Status**: BLOCKED - Needs Planner decision
```

## Verification Commands

Use project-detected test commands. Common patterns:

```bash
# Run tests (detected from project config)
/workflow-skill:test-runner

# Check SOLID compliance
/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer --path=src/modified-path

# Fix linting
/workflow-skill:lint-fixer
```

## Compound Effect

Good work execution compounds:
- TDD prevents regressions
- Checkpoints enable session resumption
- Documentation helps onboarding
- Tests become living specifications
