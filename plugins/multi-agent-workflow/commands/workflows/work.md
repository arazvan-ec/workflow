# Multi-Agent Workflow: Work

Execute implementation with the compound engineering principle: make each unit of work easier.

## Flow Guard (prerequisite check)

Before executing, verify the flow has been followed:

```
PREREQUISITE CHECK:
  1. Does 50_state.md exist for this feature?
     - NO: STOP. Run /workflows:plan first.

  2. Is planner status = COMPLETED in 50_state.md?
     - NO (PENDING or IN_PROGRESS): STOP. Planning not finished. Run /workflows:plan.
     - NO (BLOCKED): STOP. Planning is blocked. Resolve blocker first.
     - YES: Continue to work.

  3. Does the role's status allow starting work?
     - PENDING: OK, start work (set to IN_PROGRESS)
     - IN_PROGRESS: OK, resume work from last checkpoint
     - COMPLETED: Work already done. Confirm re-work with user.
     - BLOCKED: Show blocker details, ask user how to proceed.

  If checks 1 or 2 fail, do NOT proceed. Plan first.
```

## Automatic Operations (built into this command)

The following are executed automatically as part of `/workflows:work`:
- **Git sync** (Step 2) -- pulls latest changes before starting
- **TDD enforcement** (Step 5) -- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **SOLID verification** (Step 7) -- checks score at each checkpoint
- **Bounded Correction Protocol** (Step 6) -- auto-corrects up to 10 iterations
- **Checkpoint** (Step 7) -- saves progress + commits after each logical unit
- **Snapshot** -- triggered when context exceeds 70% capacity

You do NOT need to invoke these separately.

## Usage

```bash
# By Role (standard)
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=roles --role=backend
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=roles --role=frontend

# By Layer (DDD)
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=layers --layer=domain
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=layers --layer=application
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=layers --layer=infrastructure

# By Stack
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=stacks --stack=backend
/workflows:work user-auth --mode=stacks --stack=frontend
```

## Execution Mode Resolution

Before executing tasks, resolve the execution mode:

` ` `
1. READ core/providers.yaml → providers.execution_mode

2. IF "auto":
   ├── Is the task in a LOW trust area (auth/, security/, payment/)?
   │   YES → hybrid (agent generates, human reviews)
   │
   ├── Does the task have a "Reference" file in 30_tasks.md?
   │   YES → agent-executes (pattern exists to follow)
   │
   └── OTHERWISE → agent-executes (default)

3. IF --exec flag passed → override (session only)
` ` `

### Agent Executes (default)

The agent generates code following the plan. For each task in `30_tasks.md`:

` ` `
TASK EXECUTION LOOP:
  1. READ task (acceptance criteria, SOLID requirements, reference file)
  2. READ reference file to learn existing pattern
  3. WRITE test FIRST (TDD Red) — Write tool creates test file
  4. RUN tests → confirm failure (test-runner)
  5. WRITE implementation following pattern — Write/Edit tools
  6. RUN tests (test-runner)
  7. IF fail → analyze + fix (BCP, max 10 iterations)
  8. CHECK SOLID (solid-analyzer) — must meet task thresholds
  9. FIX lint (lint-fixer)
  10. CHECKPOINT → update 50_state.md
  11. → Next task
` ` `

### Human Guided

The agent presents each task with detailed instructions. The human implements. The agent verifies with test-runner and solid-analyzer.

### Hybrid

Same as agent-executes, but pauses before each checkpoint:
` ` `
After step 9 (lint fixed, tests passing):
  → Present generated code to human
  → Wait for: [Accept] [Modify] [Reject]
  → Accept: proceed to checkpoint
  → Modify: incorporate changes, re-run tests
  → Reject: regenerate with human feedback
` ` `

## Parallelization Modes

### Mode: Roles (Standard)
```
Planner → Backend + Frontend (parallel) → QA
```

**Roles available**: `backend`, `frontend`

**Best for**:
- Full-stack features with separate concerns
- Teams with distinct frontend/backend developers
- Standard feature development

### Mode: Layers (DDD)
```
Domain + Application + Infrastructure (can run parallel)
```

**Layers available**: `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`

**Best for**:
- Complex business logic
- Backend-heavy features
- DDD architecture compliance

### Mode: Stacks
```
Backend complete + Frontend complete (parallel)
```

**Stacks available**: `backend`, `frontend`

**Best for**:
- Independent features
- Separate deployment pipelines
- Large features with clear boundaries

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Load Context

```bash
# Based on mode, load appropriate agent
--mode=roles --role=backend → Read: agents/roles/backend.md
--mode=roles --role=frontend → Read: agents/roles/frontend.md
--mode=layers --layer=domain → Read: agents/roles/backend.md + rules/ddd_rules.md
```

### Step 2: Git Sync

```bash
git pull origin feature/${FEATURE_ID} || git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Load Feature Context

```bash
Read: .ai/project/features/${FEATURE_ID}/50_state.md
Read: .ai/project/features/${FEATURE_ID}/FEATURE_*.md
Read: .ai/project/features/${FEATURE_ID}/30_tasks.md
```

### Step 4: Verify Prerequisites

**For Roles mode**:
- Check Planner status is COMPLETED
- If `frontend`: Check if backend API ready or mock needed

**For Layers mode**:
- Domain: Can start immediately
- Application: Domain should be COMPLETED (or mock)
- Infrastructure: Application should be COMPLETED

### Step 5: Execute with TDD + SOLID

Execution behavior depends on the resolved execution mode (see Execution Mode Resolution above).

**In `agent-executes` mode** (default), the agent performs all steps autonomously following the Task Execution Loop. The TDD cycle is executed directly by the agent using Write, Edit, and tool invocations.

**In `human-guided` mode**, the agent presents each task with detailed instructions, acceptance criteria, and reference patterns. The human engineer performs the TDD cycle manually. The agent verifies results with test-runner and solid-analyzer after each task.

**In `hybrid` mode**, the agent executes autonomously but pauses before each checkpoint for human review (Accept / Modify / Reject).

Regardless of mode, follow the TDD cycle for each task, ensuring SOLID compliance:

```
1. 🔴 RED: Write test FIRST (must fail)
2. 🟢 GREEN: Write minimum code to pass
3. 🔵 REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green
4. ✅ SOLID: Verify code follows SOLID patterns from 15_solutions.md
```

**SOLID Verification During Implementation**:

```bash
# After each logical unit, verify SOLID compliance
/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer --path=src/modified-path

# Must match expected score from 15_solutions.md
# If score < expected, refactor before proceeding
```

### Step 6: Bounded Auto-Correction Protocol

```python
iterations = 0
MAX_ITERATIONS = 10

while tests_failing and iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS:
    analyze_error()
    fix_code()
    run_tests()
    iterations += 1

if tests_passing:
    checkpoint_complete()
else:
    document_blocker()
    mark_blocked()
```

### Step 7: Checkpoint (includes SOLID verification)

After each logical unit:

```bash
# 1. Verify SOLID score
/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer --path=src/modified-path

# 2. Only checkpoint if SOLID score meets expected
/workflows:checkpoint ${ROLE} ${FEATURE_ID} "Completed ${UNIT}"
```

**Checkpoint SOLID Requirements**:

| Checkpoint Type | SOLID Requirement |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Domain layer | SRP, DIP must score ≥4/5 |
| Application layer | SRP, OCP must score ≥4/5 |
| Infrastructure | DIP must score ≥4/5 |
| Full feature | Total score must be ≥18/25 |

```

## Verification Commands

### Backend
```bash
php bin/phpunit                          # All tests
php bin/phpunit --coverage-text          # Coverage check
./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run  # Style check
```

## Compound Effect

Good work execution compounds:
- TDD prevents regressions
- Checkpoints enable session resumption
- Documentation helps onboarding
- Tests become living specifications
