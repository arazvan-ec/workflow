# State: Planner

**Feature**: example-todo-api
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-15 00:00:00 UTC
**Status**: PENDING

## Current Task
Initial planning phase - awaiting Planner to start

## Completed Tasks
- (none yet - this is the starting state)

## Blocked By
- (none)

## Notes

This is an example feature to demonstrate the workflow system.

**Instructions for Planner:**
1. Read `workflow.yaml` and understand your role
2. Review the pre-filled `definition.md` (already provided as example)
3. Create `tasks.md` breaking down the implementation
4. Update this file with status: COMPLETED
5. Commit and push your changes

Since this is an example, the `definition.md` is pre-filled for learning purposes.
In a real workflow, the Planner would create this from scratch based on user requirements.
